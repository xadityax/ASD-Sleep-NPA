# ASD-Sleep-NPA
Network Pathway analysis approach to understanding the comorbidity of Sleep disorders with Autism Spectrum Disorder

### Workflow

1. Verification of work done till now. 
2. Detailed analysis of the network.
3. Presenting "scientifically", the results obtained for a possible publication.

### To Do (Current)
1. Verification and Study
2. Feed genes (alias if required) to STRING

### Status Updates go here : - 
Week 1 - Verification (AA), PPI network study? (AD)

Meet Discussion 

- Go ahead only with Sleep disorderd, MUST link with ASD.

- HOW to validate list of genes? Review paper for sleep disorders genetics?

- Physical and Functional layer possiblity.

Week 2 - Verification of Genes and Proteins (AA+AD)

Meet Discussion

- Complete the list of genes using Oxford TB

- Clean and finalize list and submit to STRING

- Analysis of Network in Detail

Week 3 - Compiling genes from all sources - Oxford TB - Final list of genes

Meet Discussion

- Validation using another NPA tool

Week 4 - Fed to STRING, Aliasing, Clustering (AD), AA read STRING properties in detail.

Meet Discussion

- David, Visant
- Start anal
- String confidence scores
